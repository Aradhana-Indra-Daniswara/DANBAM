      <p>A 38 years-old chef that started it all. He opened DanBam
        in Indonesia on the 17th of August 2004. He only started with 5 of his friends

      <p>It's like putting a salt on a wound. While he was stressed out with DanBam, his father died at the age of 75.
        He was desperate, lost, nowhere to talk to. He started to borrow some money to his friends, but none are willing
        to help.

      <h1>Risen From The Ashes</h1>
      <p>From the inheritance of his father, He started creating his own recipes, his own twist on korean cuisine. Out
        of 120 dishes, he only picked
        40 to be put on the menu. And what he achieved, is astonishing. The dishes are so delicious that the
        restaurant is fully booked the night he finished his recipes.
